# Marla Stemper's SQL Portfolio

Hello and welcome to my personal SQL portfolio! In this repository you will find some projects I have been working on that showcase the SQL skills I have acquired through vasrious online learning courses with Khan Academy, LinkedIn Learning, and personal study. You will also find a Tableau dashboard with visual representations of my project findings. Feel free to look around and reach out to me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/marla-stemper-aa1309114).

## SQL Projects
- **Etsy Shop Analysis** - In this project, I started from the bottom and created my own relational database, comprising of tables I considered to be useful to analyze my personal Etsy sweatshirt shop. These tables reflect the most popular items I sell, the customers that have made purchases of these items, and the order details for each transaction. You will also find some queries I composed and ran using SQLite software in order to generate some key business insights.
- **Other Analysis** - This project uses an existing relational database extracted from Kaggle from which I derived business related questions and showcase my knowledge of SQL to answer those questions. Then I take these answers a step futher and provide explanation as to how this business can use these insights to make future business decicions.

## Tableau Projects
- **Other Analysis Dashboard** - I used the reports ran through my SQL queries previously outlined to create a visually appealing dashboard that anyone can read and understand. These charts and graphics can easily be used to communicate the business analysis that occurred to those making business decisions.
