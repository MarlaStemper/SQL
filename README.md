## SQL Projects
- **Etsy Shop Data and Analysis** - In this project, I started from the bottom and created my own relational database, comprising of tables I considered to be useful to analyze my personal Etsy sweatshirt shop. These tables reflect the most popular items I sell, the customers that have made purchases of these items, and the order details for each transaction. You will also find some queries I composed in order to generate some key business insights that could futher the success of the shop.
